## Vision Statement

PowerTwinAI is an AI-powered Digital Twin and Predictive Maintenance Platform for Electrical Infrastructure.

The platform aims to automate transmission tower inspection using drones, computer vision, 3D reconstruction, and artificial intelligence.

## Core Objectives

PowerTwinAI is being developed to achieve the following objectives:

* Capture transmission tower images using autonomous drones.
* Upload inspection data to the cloud.
* Generate a 3D digital twin.
* Detect tower components automatically.
* Identify defects such as corrosion, damaged insulators, and missing hardware.
* Localize defects within the 3D model.
* Generate asset health scores.
* Provide maintenance recommendations.
* Maintain inspection history for predictive maintenance.

## Long-Term Vision

To create a scalable infrastructure intelligence platform that can be extended to:

* Transmission Towers
* Substations
* Transformers
* Solar Power Plants
* Wind Farms
