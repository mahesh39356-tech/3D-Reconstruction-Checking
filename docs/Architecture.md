## Purpose

This document defines the software architecture of PowerTwinAI Version 1.0. It describes the overall system structure, core software subsystems, architectural principles, data flow, technology choices, and design decisions that guide the development of the platform.

The purpose of this document is to provide a technical blueprint for developers, contributors, researchers, and future maintainers. Rather than describing implementation details, it explains how the major components of PowerTwinAI interact and how the architecture is designed to support future expansion into a complete AI-powered Digital Twin platform.

## 1. System Overview

PowerTwinAI Version 1.0 is an AI-assisted inspection software designed for electrical infrastructure. The system reconstructs three-dimensional models from two-dimensional inspection images, identifies electrical components using artificial intelligence, detects visually observable defects, and generates structured inspection reports for engineers.

Although Version 1.0 focuses on electrical infrastructure inspection, the software architecture has been designed with modularity and scalability in mind. Future versions are intended to expand beyond reconstruction and inspection by incorporating Digital Twin management, inspection analytics, predictive maintenance, cloud services, and enterprise asset management.

PowerTwinAI therefore represents both a functional inspection application in its current form and the architectural foundation for a larger infrastructure intelligence platform.

---

## 2. Design Philosophy

PowerTwinAI is designed using a modular software architecture in which each major subsystem is responsible for a well-defined task. This approach reduces coupling between components, improves maintainability, and allows individual modules to evolve independently as the project grows.

Version 1.0 focuses on solving a complete inspection workflow rather than attempting to implement every planned capability of the long-term platform. The architecture therefore emphasizes simplicity, extensibility, and incremental development, ensuring that new capabilities can be integrated without requiring major redesign of the existing system.

The guiding philosophy of PowerTwinAI is to establish a strong engineering foundation through clearly defined software responsibilities, comprehensive documentation, and scalable system design before expanding into enterprise-scale Digital Twin and infrastructure intelligence capabilities.

---

## 3. High-Level Architecture

PowerTwinAI Version 1.0 is organized as a sequence of interconnected software subsystems that together perform an end-to-end infrastructure inspection workflow.

The architecture consists of seven core subsystems:

1. Image Acquisition
2. Image Preprocessing
3. 2D-to-3D Reconstruction Engine
4. Electrical Component Detection Engine
5. Defect Detection Engine
6. Inspection Report Generator
7. Visualization Interface

Each subsystem performs a specific responsibility and communicates with other subsystems through clearly defined outputs, allowing future modules to be integrated with minimal impact on the existing architecture.

---

## 4. Core Platform Modules

PowerTwinAI Version 1.0 is composed of seven primary software subsystems. Each subsystem has a clearly defined responsibility and contributes to the overall infrastructure inspection workflow.

### 4.1 Image Acquisition

The Image Acquisition subsystem is responsible for receiving inspection images that serve as the input for the reconstruction and analysis pipeline. In Version 1.0, images are uploaded manually through the user interface. Future versions may support autonomous drone missions, cloud synchronization, and real-time image streaming.

### 4.2 Image Preprocessing

The Image Preprocessing subsystem prepares input images for reconstruction and artificial intelligence models. Typical preprocessing operations include image resizing, enhancement, and background preparation to improve the quality and consistency of downstream processing.

### 4.3 2D-to-3D Reconstruction Engine

The Reconstruction Engine converts multiple two-dimensional images into a three-dimensional representation of the inspected infrastructure. This subsystem forms the foundation of PowerTwinAI Version 1.0 and generates point clouds, camera poses, and reconstructed geometry for visualization and further analysis.

### 4.4 Electrical Component Detection Engine

The Component Detection Engine identifies electrical infrastructure components such as transmission towers, insulators, conductors, cross arms, and other supported assets using artificial intelligence. The detected components provide contextual information for subsequent defect analysis.

### 4.5 Defect Detection Engine

The Defect Detection Engine analyzes identified infrastructure components and detects visually observable defects such as corrosion, rust, missing bolts, damaged insulators, and other supported fault categories. The subsystem combines contextual information from the reconstruction and component detection stages to improve inspection accuracy.

### 4.6 Inspection Report Generator

The Inspection Report Generator consolidates reconstruction statistics, detected components, identified defects, and inspection summaries into a structured report. The generated report provides engineers with actionable information that supports maintenance and decision-making.

### 4.7 Visualization Interface

The Visualization Interface presents reconstruction results, detected components, identified defects, and inspection reports through an interactive user interface. This subsystem enables users to review inspection outcomes and understand the condition of the inspected infrastructure.

## 5. Data Flow

PowerTwinAI Version 1.0 follows a sequential inspection workflow in which information flows through the seven core subsystems.

The overall processing pipeline is defined as follows:

```
Inspection Images
        │
        ▼
Image Acquisition
        │
        ▼
Image Preprocessing
        │
 ┌──────┴────────┐
 ▼               ▼
2D-to-3D     Component
Reconstruction Detection
        │         │
        └────┬────┘
             ▼
     Defect Detection
             │
             ▼
Inspection Report Generator
             │
             ▼
Visualization Interface
```

This workflow ensures that each subsystem performs an independent responsibility while sharing only the information required by downstream modules. Such separation improves maintainability, simplifies future extensions, and allows additional AI capabilities to be integrated without redesigning the complete system.

## 6. Current Implementation (Version 3)

The current implementation of PowerTwinAI represents Version 3 of the reconstruction system and serves as the first functional subsystem of the overall platform.

Version 3 provides:

- Manual image acquisition through the Streamlit interface
- Image preprocessing
- Automated 2D-to-3D reconstruction
- Sparse and dense reconstruction
- Point cloud visualization
- Reconstruction analytics

At the time of writing, artificial intelligence-based component detection, defect detection, and automated inspection reporting are planned as future development stages.

---

## 7. Future Architecture

The architecture of PowerTwinAI has been intentionally designed to support incremental expansion without requiring major restructuring of the existing software.

Future versions are expected to introduce additional subsystems including:

- AI-based Electrical Component Detection
- AI-based Defect Detection
- Digital Twin Management
- Inspection Analytics
- Asset Health Assessment
- Predictive Maintenance
- Cloud-based Infrastructure Management

Each future subsystem will be integrated as an independent software module while preserving the modular architecture established in Version 1.0.

---

## 8. Scalability Strategy

PowerTwinAI follows a modular and extensible architecture that allows new capabilities to be integrated without redesigning existing software components.

The architecture supports scalability by:

- Separating software responsibilities into independent subsystems.
- Minimizing dependencies between modules.
- Encouraging reusable software components.
- Supporting future AI models without modifying the reconstruction engine.
- Allowing future cloud services and enterprise deployment.

This strategy enables PowerTwinAI to evolve from a reconstruction application into a comprehensive infrastructure intelligence platform.

---

## 9. Design Principles

The architecture of PowerTwinAI is guided by the following engineering principles:

- Modularity
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Extensibility
- Reusability
- Separation of Responsibilities
- Incremental Development
- Clear Documentation
- Engineering-First Design

These principles influence architectural decisions throughout the development of the project.
