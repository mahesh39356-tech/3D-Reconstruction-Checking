## Project Introduction

PowerTwinAI is a long-term research and software engineering project focused on building an AI-powered Digital Twin platform for electrical infrastructure. The project aims to combine computer vision, artificial intelligence, and digital twin technologies to automate infrastructure inspection, condition assessment, and predictive maintenance.

The current implementation (Version 3) focuses on image-based 2D-to-3D reconstruction using Python, OpenCV, Open3D, Streamlit, and COLMAP. This reconstruction system serves as the foundational subsystem for future modules including AI-based defect detection, digital twin generation, inspection analytics, asset management, and cloud-based monitoring.

PowerTwinAI is being developed as both a research initiative and an engineering platform, with an emphasis on documenting every stage of its evolution to support learning, collaboration, and future real-world deployment.

## Vision

PowerTwinAI is envisioned as a complete AI-powered Digital Twin platform for electrical infrastructure. The long-term goal is to enable intelligent inspection, condition assessment, defect detection, predictive maintenance, and digital asset management using computer vision, artificial intelligence, and cloud technologies.

The current V3 reconstruction module represents the first milestone of this vision by providing automated image-based 3D reconstruction, forming the foundation upon which future AI modules will be built.
